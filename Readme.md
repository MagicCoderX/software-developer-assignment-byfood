# 📚 Assessment Catalog 📚

This project is a web system for managing a book catalog, with a backend in Go and a frontend in Next.js. The system uses a database and has a REST API for interaction.

## 💻 Technologies Used:

**Backend:**

- Go
- Database (mySQL)

**Frontend:**

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS

  - `urlcontroller.go`: Possibly manages short URLs or redirects.
- `database/` 🗄️: Interaction with the database.
  - `client.go`: Implementation of the database client.
- `entities/` 📦: Models of the system entities (e.g., books).
  - `book.go`: Defines the data structure of a book.
- `go.mod`, `go.sum`: Dependency management of Go.
